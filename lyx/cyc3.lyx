From this we can look at it one term at a time and make assumptions to get
 equations like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $r=\frac{k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}}{k_{-2}k_{-3}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{2}+k_{1}+k_{-1}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $k_{3}$
\end_inset

 very large) or 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 is exceptionally small)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, these terms should move in tandem with one another.
 A change that affects one rate constant must affect at least one more.
 Realistically, there are a few things we can modify:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Concentrations (O2, pH, ect.) that might accelerate a particular rate in
 a specific direction, but probably affects several.
 It has the neat feature for pH that all of them are at least likely to
 point the same direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 We can modify a barrier height.
 A decrease in the height will increase both the forward and backward rate
 constant for that transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 We can modify an intermediate energy, which will increase the rates that
 point toward that node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how about we tackle 1, where we just append in some pH terms and look
 at what it can do
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Game Plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make up some data that reasonably fits the experimental data that Elise
 and Alex each saw, and see whether we can reasonably fit this equation
 to that data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we kind of want to fit a somewhat weird function, which is we want to
 know when this function is above a certain value.
 We can't use 0 because that misses the fact that this function can spend
 a long range of applied potential for a given pH at near 0 current
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does it mean for the intermediate and TS energy to apply a pH or potential
 dependence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For pH, either the forward or reverse reaction is generally considered to
 have the rate dependence.
 Realistically, both of them have a dependence...
 but it's kind of complex? We have 2 processes that achieve the same products
 from essentially interchangeable reactants, but they have different activation
 energies.
 Assumptions about those differing activation energies could change conclusions
 about rate dependence on pH under certain conditions.
 So what really makes a rate dependence linear? I don't think it can actually
 be fully understood as just modifying the energy of the transition states
 and intermediates; there is no limit to how much pH (or other species)
 can theoretically modify the rate, so we'll have to include those effects
 separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $r=k[H^{+}]e^{-E_{A}/RT}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $r_{-}=ke^{-E_{A}-\Delta G}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How exactly does pH dependence propagate into the formalism that we've adopted?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pick a node, pick a branch.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 a unique tree that has arrows that end at that node and do not include
 that branch.
 Draw branches both directions (there is a backward and forward path, although
 one may be null.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The 3 Cycle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is getting complicated and annoying, so I'm going to switch to a specific
 case for the moment.
 Assuming that we have some chemical O2 bonding, followed by a pair of PCET
 steps, I should be able to work out how the O2 and pH dependence looks.
 Now, I've figured out how pH fits into the terms (sort of? there may be
 a more general way to include both pH mechanisms with certain assumptions,
 but we're going with the base mechanism for now).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the potential dependence, I guess it's a matter of figuring out which
 trees have more forward than reverse potential dependencies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some 0 potential and 0 pH, the reaction should have a specific set of
 free energies and transition states.
 We'll use those as inputs, along with directly mixing in potential and
 pH dependence.
 Now separate from pH dependence, potential dependence kind of goes both
 ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $k=k^{o}e^{-\alpha f\eta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{-}=k_{-}^{o}e^{(1-\alpha)f\eta}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So for this mechanism, we've got the first term that's also potential independen
t, but 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\pm2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\pm3}$
\end_inset

 have this potential dependence (and we're lumping the reverse rate constant
 with the pOH dependence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $r=\frac{k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}e^{-fV}-k_{-1}k_{-2}k_{-3}e^{fV}[OH]^{2}}{k_{1}k_{2}e^{-0.5fV}+k_{1}k_{-2}e^{0.5fV}[OH]+k_{2}k_{3}^{-fV}+k_{2}k_{-3}[OH]+k_{3}k_{1}e^{-0.5fV}+k_{3}k_{-1}e^{-0.5fV}+k_{-1}k_{-3}e^{0.5fV}[OH]+k_{-2}k_{-3}e^{fV}[OH]^{2}+k_{-1}k_{-2}e^{0.5fV}[OH]}$
\end_inset

The range of tafel slopes here is 0, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-0.5fV}$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-fV}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-1.5fV}$

\begin_inset Formula $e^{-2fV}$
\end_inset

, which translate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

, 120, 60, 40, 30 mV/dec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $r=\frac{k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}e^{-2\alpha fV}-k_{-1}k_{-2}k_{-3}e^{2(1-\alpha)fV}[OH]^{2}}{k_{1}k_{2}e^{-\alpha f\eta_{1}}+k_{1}k_{-2}[OH]+k_{2}k_{3}+k_{2}k_{-3}[OH]+k_{3}k_{1}+k_{3}k_{-1}+k_{-1}k_{-3}[OH]+k_{-2}k_{-3}[OH]^{2}+k_{-1}k_{-2}[OH]}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm not sure I can totally do this with the intermediate-and-transition
 state representation.
 The cycle is inherently biased forward by the production of water from
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{2}$
\end_inset

 gas, meaning that even if an intermediate has a higher free energy, the
 step leading there may have a negative free energy as it produces water.
 The fix for this would be to include this energetic contribution in the
 calculation.
 --> Actually, this probably is where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{rxn}$
\end_inset

 comes into play, so I think I just need to go back and make sure that I'm
 including this properly.
 At the very least I should be able to co-opt it for purposes of the production
 of water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think rather than making some pretty fast and loose assumptions about
 Butler-Volmer equation, it's probably possible to insert some rate constants
 from some of SHS's work to get a more realistic picture.
 This is probably a good place to start after hammering down some of the
 initial dependencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, given where I currently am, there should be some way to observe pH
 dependencies.
 Let's start with a test case that we understand: a base mediated mechanism.
 I'm seeing some somewhat peculiar behavior that a base-mediated mechanism
 has something like half-order mV/pH dependence.
 I need to make sure I can recover nernstian pH dependence in a regime where
 I expect it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How exactly do I plot Tafel slopes? We discuss the Tafel slope as being
 in mV/dec, namely that there is some rise over run (of like 59 mV/dec for
 current, or for pH, or 118 mV/dec ect).
 So if we plot log(I) vs V, we should see that the plot resolves itself
 into a series of lines, with some slope 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial log(I)}{\partial V}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we'd kind of prefer to have mV/dec instead of dec/mV, so if we
 invert it we should obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial V}{\partial log(I)}=0.0118mV/dec*n$
\end_inset

, where n is a constant, often fractional.
 We're interested in knowing this value as a function of potential, so we
 should take the gradient
