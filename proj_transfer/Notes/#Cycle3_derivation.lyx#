\begin_layout Standard
I will derive here the general rate equation for a cyclic, reversible reaction
 mechanism with 3 intermediates,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightleftharpoons B\rightleftharpoons C\rightleftharpoons A$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
under the steady-state approximation (SSA).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightleftharpoons B$
\end_inset

 has a forward reaction rate constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the reverse reaction has a backward rate constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{-1}$
\end_inset

, the reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $B\rightleftharpoons C$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{-2}$
\end_inset

 , and the reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $C\rightleftharpoons A$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{-3}$
\end_inset

, then under SSA we can write rate equations for the intermediates as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}=-(k_{1}+k_{-3})\theta_{A}+k_{-1}\theta_{B}+k_{3}\theta_{C}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the surface coverage for species i.
 Note that these rate constants can contain voltage or pH dependencies,
 as these need not yet be made explicit and the derivation can be kept general.
 For this particular mechanism, I've assumed that all of the surface sites
 do not interact with one another, which is a good assumption for the graphite-c
onjugated catalysts, a decent assumption for Professor Dinca's MOFs, and
 a possibly incorrect assumption for the gold surfaces Megan Jackson was
 investigating in Yogi's group (I explicitly note this in the event that
 the first two I name here can be represented by these models and the third
 cannot).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corresponding rate equations for B and C follow a similar structure.
 Since the sites aren't interacting, under the steady-state approximation
 these may be arranged as a matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-(k_{1}+k_{-3}) & k_{-1} & k_{3}\\
k_{1} & -(k_{2}+k_{-1}) & k_{-2}\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\theta_{1}\\
\theta_{2}\\
\theta_{3}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
1
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last row is a normalization factor rather than the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

, as this equation for C is not linearly independent from the equations
 for A and B, but there is a necessary normalization factor for the values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, which I have chosen here to be 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving these equations for the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, and then plugging these into a general rate equation, yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $R=\frac{k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}-k_{-1}k_{-2}k_{-3}}{k_{1}k_{2}+k_{2}k_{3}+k_{1}k_{3}+k_{3}k_{-1}+k_{1}k_{-2}+k_{2}k_{-3}+k_{-1}k_{-2}+k_{-1}k_{-3}+k_{-2}k_{-3}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sebastian Kozuch goes over this in the chapter 9 of the book Understanding
 Organometallic Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis: Experiments and Computational
 Tools, but these equations have the nice form in that they can also be
 derived from the subgraphs of the full reaction mechanism graph for any
 linear reaction mechanism, even if it is not the very simple cycle that
 I've drawn above.
 Of course, from what I've worked with so far, I'm not sure a more complex
 cycle will specifically reproduce the results that Yogi and Professor Dinca
 have seen, which Sebastian Kozuch confirmed when I met with him.

\begin_layout Subsection*
pH, Voltage and Current Relationships
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The go-to mechanism for representing the rate constants in electrochemical
 systems is the Butler-Volmer equation, which for a 1-step, reversible electron
 transfer is represented as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $J=k_{1}^{0}e^{-\alpha fV}-k_{-1}^{0}e^{(1-\alpha)fV}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where J is current, essentially the overall rate, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a constant.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is often treated as a constant at 0.5, but its value can be derived to range
 from 0-1 based on Marcus theory.
 The value of 0.5 is assumed because, according to Marcus Theory, it will
 be close to that value near the point where a small electrical current
 can be observed.
 I'm excluding pH dependence for a moment.
 I've added 0's above the k's to indicate they now are just vanilla rate
 constants that don't have pH or voltage dependence (although they still
 have a temperature dependence) to distinguish them from above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of electrochemists will measure what they call a Tafel slope for a
 system, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial V}{\partial log_{10}J}$
\end_inset

, which you'll notice does the odd thing of putting the independent variable,
 voltage, above the dependent variable, current.
 This unfortunate notation is probably historical.
 For the mechanism I showed above, assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 the Tafel slope is 120mV/dec, or 120mV per 10x change in current.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the 3-step mechanism I showed above, if every step is just a 1-electron
 transfer, there are 3 Tafel slopes that it could produce over a sustained
 range of voltage, each based on a limiting case of the mechanism where
 one part of the denominator dominates the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 2 forward steps dominate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $R=k_{i}^{0}e^{-\alpha fV}$
\end_inset

, which is just the forward rate of the Butler-Volmer equation, and has
 a 120 mV/dec Tafel slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 1 forward step and 1 reverse step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $R=\frac{k_{i}^{0}k_{j}^{0}e^{-2\alpha fV}}{k_{-i}e^{(1-\alpha)fV}}$
\end_inset

, which has a 40 mV/dec Tafel slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 2 reverse steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $R=\frac{k_{i}^{0}k_{j}^{0}k_{m}e^{-3\alpha fV}}{k_{-i}k_{-j}e^{2(1-\alpha)fV}}$
\end_inset

, which has a 24 mV/dec Tafel slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Including pH dependence in these terms is as (to an approximation) as simple
 as adding 
\begin_inset Formula $[H^{+}]$
\end_inset

 to the forward rate or or 
\begin_inset Formula $[OH^{-}]$
\end_inset

 to the reverse rate.
 For Butler-Volmer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $J=k_{1}^{0}[H^{+}]e^{-\alpha fV}-k_{-1}^{0}e^{(1-\alpha)fV}$
\end_inset

 (acid)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $J=k_{1}^{0}e^{-\alpha fV}-k_{-1}^{0}[OH^{-}]e^{(1-\alpha)fV}$
\end_inset

 (base)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way pH dependence is generally measured for an electrochemical mechanism
 is by measuring how much the voltage must be changed to keep the current
 constant when the pH is changed.
 This creates a mV/pH measurement as the general way to describe pH dependence
 for these mechanisms.
 In the Butler-Volmer equation above, the acid mechanism has a 120mV/pH
 dependence for the forward step, and none for the backward step
